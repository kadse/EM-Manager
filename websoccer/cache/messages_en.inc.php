        <p><strong>Set players</strong></p>
        <p>You can drag players onto the pitch with your mouse. Or you simply tap on the appropriate buttons or doubleclick on the player rows. Note that doubleclick only works when the player has an assigned main position and this main position is not occupied yet.</p>
        
    	<p><strong>Substitution players</strong></p>

<p>Train your team regularly in order to improve stamina, technique and freshness of your players.</p>

<p>How you train your team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a trainer and hire him for a number of training units.</li>
<li>If you have hired a trainer, you can determine the intensity and training focus.</li>
<li>Click on button \"Execute training\". The players will be trained immediately under the supervision of the trainer, considering your preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot execute trainings during a match.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing a trainer</strong></p>

<p>The figures for \"Effectivity\" indicate how successful the trainer can train your team. 50% means, for instance, that players will be improved during a training session by a chance of 50%.</p>

<p>Note that the trainer\'s fee will be debitted immediately after you have hired him.</p>

<p><strong>Execute training</strong></p>

<p>If you execute a training session, the players\' strengths will be improved according to the trainer\'s effectivity and configured intensitiy. The higher the intensity is, the more freshness your players will loose, but the higher is the chance of improvements.</p>

<p>Injured players cannot train, but regenerate during training sessions.</p>

<li>Popularity with fans. It depends on your current success.</li>

<p>You can sell players to any time by clicking on the button \"Sell\" next to the appropriate player. Afterwards you will enter a minimum bid. The player will be moved to the transfer market and other users can bid for him. As long as the player is not sold, he will remain in your team.</p>

<p>Note that you cannot remove a player from the transfer market once you have added him.</p>

<p><strong>Extend contracts</strong></p>

<p>Players whose contract is about to end and can be extended, will be marked red and with a danger sign in the overview. It also appears a button \"Extend Contract\". On click on this button you will be forwarded to a contract extension negotiation page.</p>

<p>If you do not extend an ending contract, the player will be moved automatically to the transfer market and does not belong to your team anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Nominate a team captain</strong></p>
<p>The captain can improve the team morale when your team is in deficit during a match. The more experience a player has, the more respekt he gets from other players.</p>

<p>Players without currently having a team will be given to the team which offers the best contract to the player. It is considered as best according to the total income for the player, including awards and hand money. The goal bonus is irrelevant for goalkeepers and defense players.</p>
